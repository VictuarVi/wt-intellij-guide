\section{Preliminaries}

The tech stack is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item IntelliJ Idea Ultimate as Java IDE and Maven as build system
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Datagrip as SQL IDE
    \end{itemize}
  \item MariaDB, a retrocompatible fork of MySQL
  \item Tomcat as application server
\end{itemize}

\begin{hint}[OS compatibility]{}
  Although the guide has been verified on Arch Linux, since all of JetBrains' IDEs are cross-platform, apart from the installation process, commands and paths the configuration will be the same on \textit{every} operating system.
\end{hint}

Programs and dependencies needed:
\begin{minted}{shell}
  # from ufficial repositories
  sudo pacman -S jdk21-openjdk mariadb tomcat10 maven

  # from AUR
  yay -S intellij-idea-ultimate-edition mariadb-jdbc
\end{minted}

to install \texttt{yay} check the \href{https://github.com/Jguer/yay?tab=readme-ov-file#installation}{official repository}.

All of Datagrip functionalities are integrated in every JetBrains' IDE, so its not stricly needed -- however, if you want install Datagrip as a standalone application:
\begin{minted}{shell}
  # from AUR
  yay -S datagrip datagrip-jre
\end{minted}
